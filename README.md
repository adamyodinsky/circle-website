## landing page copy structure (for copywriting)

Keep copy compact and outcome-first. This outline is intentionally small but fuller than the current page.

### 1) Hero

- Headline (3–6 words): Core promise
- Subheadline (10–20 words): One clear outcome sentence
- Store CTAs: App Store, Google Play (labels only)
- Optional: one short trust/reassurance line

### 2) Features (3 bullets)

- Each: 2–3 word title + one-line benefit (8–14 words)

### 3) Screenshots (2 images)

- Short caption per image (5–10 words) tied to a benefit
- Descriptive alt text (brief)

### 4) Privacy

- One-sentence promise (plain language)
- 2–3 bullets: no ads, minimal data, delete anytime
- Link label present: Privacy Policy

### 5) Final CTA

- Short headline (2–4 words)
- One reinforcement line (1 sentence)
- Repeat store CTAs

### 6) Footer

- Link labels: Support, EULA, Privacy

- Hero headline + subheadline + CTA labels
- 3 feature bullets (title + one-liner)
